<h1>NASA Successfully Launches Black Brant Composite Rocket</h1>
<br>
On October 7, NASA successfully launched a Black Brant IX sounding rocket from its Wallops <br>
Flight Facility in Virginia. Orbital ATK, the manufacturer of the rocket, used 3-D printing<br>
 and ultra-lightweight carbon nanotube (CNT) composite materials to create the rockets wire<br>
 sheathing, heat and radiation shields.<br>
<br>
NASA noted Orbital ATK used a new near net shape manufacturing method that allows the cylinder<br>
 of the rocket to be formed and stiffened with internal structures in one step, rather than with <br>
dozens or hundreds of welds. According to Space Flight Insider, using hundreds of welds can be costly,<br>
 make the rocket heavier and introduce potential failure points. NASA believes this new methodology <br>
could potentially mitigate those risks for other products as well.<br>
<br>
These technologies will bring significant value to a wide range of aerospace and defense productsincluding<br>
 launch vehicles, spacecraft, aircraft and marine vehicles, NASA wrote in an October 2 online preview of the<br>
 launch. They add the technologies lead to an estimated 40-60 percent mass savings, increased technical<br>
 performance and reduced maintenance over traditional materials.<br>
<br>
Part of what makes this particular mission unique is the type of rocket used to test composite materials.<br>
<br>
The flight also provides an opportunity to test new technologies being developed for space missions<br>
 and science conducted using sounding rockets, said Cathy Hesh, technology manager in the Sounding <br>
Rocket Program Office at Wallops Flight Facility<br>

The online preview adds that eight students from the NASA Internships, Fellowships, and Scholarships <br>
program working at Langley were instrumental in supporting the construction of the experimental materials.<br>
 The interns performed the structural analysis of the flight cylinder, evaluated the microstructure and<br>
 properties and did a cost-benefit analysis of the integrally stiffened cylinder (ISC) process. They did<br>
 much of the 3-D printing for the Orbital ATK tests and acted as the liaisons between Orbital ATK and Wallops.<br>

<h1>ISRO Will Launch Indias Own Satellite Navigation: IRNSS; Will end American Monopoly Of GPS</h1>
<img src="images/new2.jpg"><br><br>
Did you know that the Global Positioning System used by almost all countries in the world is controlled by USA Govt?<br>
<br>
If they want, they can switch off this GPS without any explanation!<br>
<br>
During the Kargil war, Indian Army and Air force had to use Americas GPS, and it was a very scary situation.<br>
<br>
American monopoly on satellite based navigation is all set to end now, as Indian Space Research Organisation or<br>
 ISRO will launch Indias own desi satellite based navigation next year. Christened as Indian Regional Navigation<br>
 Satellite System or IRNSS, this navigation system would be controlled by Indian Govt.<br>
<br>
Last week, scientists at ISRO started a series of meetings with various location and navigation device manufacturers,<br>
 mobile phone companies and global information system (GIS) technology developers from all over the world; to explain<br>
 them the advantages and benefits of using IRNSS. In these meetings, senior scientists from Space Application Centre <br>
(SAC) Ahmedabad had also participated, to showcase how Indias very own IRNSS has technical advantages over American <br>
GPS system.<br>
<br>
As per reports coming in, ISRO will offer two types of services via IRNSS: Standard Positioning Service (SPS), which <br>
would be available for all users (mobile phones, ecommerce services, digital services) and Restricted Service (RS),<br>
 which would be exclusively for defense users.<br>
Advantage: IRNSS<br>
<br>
Indias IRNSS will use seven constellation satellites, which would be operational from July, 2016. Besides providing<br>
 a leading technological edge over GPS, IRNSS will enable handheld devices to receive seamless S-Band signals from <br>
these 7 satellites.<br>
<br>
Additionally, once a simple code is added in the mobile phones, they would be able to receive L-band signals as well.<br>
<br>
A senior ISRO official said, Both these L and S band signals received from seven satellite constellation of the IRNSS<br>
 are being calculated by a special embedded software which reduces the errors caused by atmospheric disturbances<br>
 significantly. This in turn gives a superior quality location accuracy than the American GPS system
