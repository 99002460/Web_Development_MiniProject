<h1>Delta IV Heavy Rocket Rolls to Launch Pad for Orion's First Flight Test</h1>
The United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Heavy rocket for Exploration Flight Test-1 rolled out<br>
 of the Horizontal Integration Facility near Space Launch Complex 37 in the evening Sept. 30, and<br>
 made the trek to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The rocket was<br> 
carried to the launch complex by an Elevating Platform Transporter.<br><br>

Early morning the next day, the nearly 180-foot-tall launch vehicle was carefully lifted into the<br>
 vertical position using the Fixed Pad Erector and then raised into the Mobile Service Tower<br>
 on the pad.<br><br>

“We’ve been working toward this launch for months, and we’re in the final stretch,” said Kennedy<br>
 Space Center Director Bob Cabana. “Orion is almost complete and the rocket that will send it into <br>
space is on the launch pad. We’re 64 days away from taking the next step in deep-space exploration.”<br><br>

About 15 ULA engineers, technicians, and representatives from safety, quality, security and other<br> 
groups ensured that the launch vehicle arrived safely at the pad.<br><br>

“This is a tremendous milestone and gets us one step closer to our launch later this year,” said<br>
Tony Taliancich, ULA’s director of East Coast Launch Operations. “The team has worked extremely hard <br>
to ensure this vehicle is processed with the utmost attention to detail and focus on mission success."<br>
<br>

For this rollout, NASA's Launch Services Program (LSP) participated in ULA's Component Responsible<br> 
Engineer Readiness Review in Denver, Colorado, and the Launch Vehicle On Stand Test Readiness Review<br> 
at the ULA launch site.<br><br>

"We review launch site processing and preparations to make sure everything that is necessary to proceed<br>
 with putting the rocket on the pad has been completed," said Merri Anne Stowe, LSP Fleet Systems <br>
Integration Branch. "We serve in an advisory role for the EFT-1 mission. We're there to help only <br>
if issues come up."<br><br>

While the Delta IV waits on the launch pad, workers have been busy at several Kennedy facilities <br>
preparing the Orion spacecraft for its flight.<br><br>

On Sept. 11, the Lockheed Martin-built Orion spacecraft, attached to its service module, moved from<br> 
the Operations and Checkout Building to the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility. The spacecraft was<br>
 fueled with ammonia, hydrazine and high-pressure helium ahead of its December flight test.<br><br>

The spacecraft was moved to the Launch Abort System Facility on Sept. 28. Work currently is underway<br>
 to install the Launch Abort System around Orion.<br><br><br>

Orion's first flight test is scheduled for Dec. 4. During the mission, the spacecraft will travel<br>
3,600 miles in altitude above the Earth and return home at speeds of 20,000 miles per hour. The <br>
spacecraft will endure temperatures near 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The flight's goals are to test<br>
 many of the systems critical to Orion, including the heat shield, the launch abort system and <br>
the parachute system.<br><br>

A team of NASA, Lockheed Martin and U.S. Navy workers, with coordination from the agency's Ground<br>
 Systems Development and Operations Program, will retrieve Orion, the forward bay cover and the <br>
parachute system after splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>

An uncrewed Orion will launch atop NASA's Space Launch System on Exploration Mission 1. The <br>
spacecraft will serve as the exploration vehicle that will carry astronauts to space and provide<br>
 safe re-entry from deep space missions.<br><br>

"There has been a lot of excellent work done to get to this point and it's exciting to see the<br>
 hardware coming together at the launch pad," Stowe said. "I'm looking forward to eventually seeing<br>
 astronauts launched from Kennedy again."<br>
