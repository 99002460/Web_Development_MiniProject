<h1>What Was the Saturn V? </h1>
The Saturn V was a rocket NASA built to send people to the moon. (The V in the name is the<br>
 Roman numeral five.) The Saturn V was a type of rocket called a Heavy Lift Vehicle. That <br>
means it was very powerful. It was the most powerful rocket that had ever flown successfully.<br>
 The Saturn V was used in the Apollo program in the 1960s and 1970s. It also was used to launch<br>
 the Skylab space station.<br><br><br>

<h4>How Big Was the Saturn V?</h4>
The Saturn V rocket was 111 meters (363 feet) tall, about the height of a 36-story-tall building,<br>
 and 18 meters (60 feet) taller than the Statue of Liberty. Fully fueled for liftoff, the Saturn V<br>
 weighed 2.8 million kilograms (6.2 million pounds), the weight of about 400 elephants. The rocket<br>
 generated 34.5 million newtons (7.6 million pounds) of thrust at launch, creating more power than <br>
85 Hoover Dams. A car that gets 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the gallon could drive around the world<br>
 around 800 times with the amount of fuel the Saturn V used for a lunar landing mission. It could <br>
launch about 118,000 kilograms (130 tons) into Earth orbit. That's about as much weight as 10 school<br>
 buses. The Saturn V could launch about 43,500 kilograms (50 tons) to the moon. That's about the <br>
same as four school buses.<br><br><br>

<h4>What Is the History of the Saturn V?</h4>
The Saturn V was developed at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. It was one of<br>
 three types of Saturn rockets NASA built. Two smaller rockets, the Saturn I (1) and IB (1b), were <br>
used to launch humans into Earth orbit. The Saturn V sent them beyond Earth orbit to the moon. The <br>
first Saturn V was launched in 1967. It was called Apollo 4. Apollo 6 followed in 1968. Both of <br>
these rockets were launched without crews. These launches tested the Saturn V rocket<br><br>

The first Saturn V launched with a crew was Apollo 8. On this mission, astronauts orbited the<br> 
moon but did not land. On Apollo 9, the crew tested the Apollo moon lander by flying it in Earth<br>
 orbit without landing. On Apollo 10, the Saturn V launched the lunar lander to the moon. The crew<br>
 tested the lander in space but did not land it on the moon. In 1969, Apollo 11 was the first <br>
mission to land astronauts on the moon. Saturn V rockets also made it possible for astronauts to<br>
 land on the moon on Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17. On Apollo 13, the Saturn V lifted the crew into<br>
 space, but a problem prevented them from being able to land on the moon. That problem was not with<br>
 the Saturn V, but with the Apollo spacecraft. The last Saturn V was launched in 1973, without a <br>
crew. It was used to launch the Skylab space station into Earth orbit<br><br><br>

<h4>How Did the Saturn V Work?</h4>
The Saturn V that launched the Skylab space station only had two stages. The Saturn V rockets used<br>
 for the Apollo missions had three stages. Each stage would burn its engines until it was out of <br>
fuel and would then separate from the rocket. The engines on the next stage would fire, and the <br>
rocket would continue into space. The first stage had the most powerful engines, since it had the<br>
 challenging task of lifting the fully fueled rocket off the ground. The first stage lifted the<br> 
rocket to an altitude of about 68 kilometers (42 miles). The second stage carried it from there <br>
almost into orbit. The third stage placed the Apollo spacecraft into Earth orbit and pushed it<br>
toward the moon. The first two stages fell into the ocean after separation. The third stage either<br>
 stayed in space or hit the moon<br>
