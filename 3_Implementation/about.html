<h1>What Is a Rocket?</h1><br>
When most people think of a rocket, they think of a tall round vehicle that flies into space. But the<br>
 word "rocket" can mean two different things. The word can describe a type of engine. The word rocket<br>
 also is used to talk about a vehicle that uses a rocket engine.<br><br>
<h4>How Does a Rocket Engine Work?</h4>
Like many other engines, a rocket produces thrust by burning fuel.Most rocket engines turn the fuel into<br>
 hot gas.Pushing the gas outof the back of the engine makes the rocket move forward.<br><br>

A rocket is different from a jet engine. A jet engine requires oxygen from the air to work. A rocket<br>
 engine carries everything it needs.That is why a rocket engine works in space, where there is no air.<br>
<br>

There are two main types of rocket engines. Some rockets use liquid fuel. The main engines on the space <br>
shuttle orbiter use liquid fuel. The Russian Soyuz uses liquid fuels. Other rockets use solid fuels.<br>
 On the side of the space shuttle are two white solid rocket boosters. They use solid fuels. Fireworks<br>
 and model rockets also fly using solid fuels.<br><br><br>
<h4>Why Does a Rocket Work?</h4>
In the vacuum of space, an engine has nothing to push against. So how do rockets move there? Rockets work<br>
 by a scientific rule called Newton's third law of motion. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton listed three<br>
 Laws of Motion more than 300 years ago. The third law says that for every action, there is an equal and<br>
opposite reaction. When the rocket pushes out its exhaust, the exhaust also pushes the rocket. The rocket<br>
 pushes the exhaust backward. The exhaust makes the rocket move forward. This rule can be seen on Earth.<br> 
If a person stands on a skateboard and throws a bowling ball, the person and the ball will move in<br>
opposite directions. Because the person is heavier, the bowling ball will move farther.<br><br><br>

<h4>When Were Rockets Invented?</h4>
The first known rockets were used in China in the 1200s. These solid rockets were used for fireworks.<br>
 They also were used by armies for war. In the 1300s, these rockets were used for the same purposes <br>
through much of Asia and Europe. In the next 600 years, people developed bigger and better solid rockets.<br>
 Many of these were used by the military.
<br><br><br>
In 1903, a Russian teacher named Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote a paper describing the idea of liquid-fuel<br> 
rockets. In 1926, American scientist Robert Goddard flew the first liquid-fuel rocket. German scientists <br>
led by Hermann Oberth improved liquid-fuel rockets. During World War II, Germany used rockets to bomb <br>
other countries. In 1957, the Soviet Union used a rocket to launch the first satellite. In 1961, Soviet<br> 
cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin rode in a rocket to become the first person in space. In 1969, the United States<br> 
launched the first men to land on the moon - Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin - using a Saturn V rocket.<br>
<br><br><br>
<h4>How Does NASA Use Rockets?</h4>
Early NASA missions used rockets built by the military. Alan Shepard became the first American in space<br>
 flying on the U.S. Army's Redstone rocket. The Atlas missile was used to make John Glenn the first<br>
American to orbit Earth. NASA's Gemini missions used the Titan II missile to launch astronauts. The<br>
 first rockets NASA built to launch astronauts were the Saturn I, the Saturn IB and the Saturn V.<br> 
Apollo missions used these to send men to the moon. A Saturn V launched the Skylab space station.<br>
 The space shuttle also uses rocket engines to carry astronauts into space. NASA uses rockets to <br>
launch satellites and to send probes to other worlds. These rockets include the Atlas V, the Delta <br>
II, the Pegasus and Taurus. NASA also uses smaller "sounding rockets" for scientific research. These<br>
 rockets go up and come back down, instead of flying into orbit.<br>
<br><br><br>
<h4>How Will NASA Use Rockets in the Future?</h4>
New rockets are being developed today that will launch astronauts on future missions. Compared to<br> 
the space shuttle, these rockets will look more like earlier rockets - tall and round and thin.<br> 
These rockets will take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station. NASA also is<br>
 working on a powerful new rocket called a heavy lift vehicle. This rocket will be able to carry<br>
 large amounts of equipment into space. Together, the heavy lift vehicle and other rockets will<br>
 make it possible to explore other worlds and may someday send humans to Mars.<br><br><br>


<h1>What Is a Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle?</h1>
A heavy lift launch vehicle is a type of rocket. "Launch vehicle" is a term used to describe rockets<br> 
that launch people or payloads. Rockets come in many sizes. Some rockets are more powerful than<br>  
others. Different rockets have different purposes. Heavy lift rockets are the most powerful type<br> 
 of rockets. NASA's Saturn V (5) rocket was the most powerful heavy lift launch vehicle to fly<br>  
successfully. Other heavy lift launch vehicles include the Titan IV (4) and Delta IV (4) Heavy,<br> 
 Russia's Proton and Europe's Ariane 5.<br> <br> <br> 

<h4>How Are Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles Used?</h4>
Heavy lift launch vehicles can do things that other rockets cannot do. They can launch larger payloads<br> 
 into low Earth orbit. The Saturn V rocket, for example, launched an entire space station, Skylab,<br>  
in one launch. The Saturn V could launch about 130 tons into Earth orbit. That's about as much weight<br> 
 as 10 school buses.<br> 
<br> <br> 
Heavy lift launch vehicles can also lift large satellites into higher orbits. These higher orbits can<br> 
 offer special benefits. For example, a satellite around 22,000 miles from the surface of Earth can be<br> 
 in geostationary orbit. In that orbit, the satellite orbits Earth once per day. As a result, it stays<br>  
over the same point on Earth's surface. This is useful for communications satellites.<br> <br> <br> 

Heavy lift launch vehicles can also be used for missions to other worlds. The Saturn V rocket made it<br> 
 possible for people to land on the moon. That rocket could launch about 50 tons to the moon. That's <br> 
about the same as four school buses. If humans are going to explore other worlds, a heavy lift launch<br> 
 vehicle could be used to make that possible.<br> <br> <br> 

<h4>What Does the Future Hold for Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles?</h4>
NASA has a new plan for the future of space exploration. The new plan will eventually lead to human<br> 
 exploration of Mars. Many steps will be needed in order to get there. New technologies will have to<br> 
 be developed. NASA is working on a new Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle. The new vehicle will use many <br> 
things NASA has learned about rockets. It will also use brand new technologies. Engineers are working<br> 
 to figure out the best way to prepare to explore the solar system.
