In its thirty first flight conducted today (September 28, 2015),<br>

 India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle successfully launched , <br>
the country's Multi Wavelength Space Observatory along with six<br>
 foreign customer satellites into a &nbsp;&nbsp;644.6 X 651.5 km<br>
 orbit inclined at an angle of 6 deg to the equator.&nbsp; The achieved<br> 
orbit is very close to the intended one.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the thirtieth<br>
 consecutive success for PSLV.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">PSLV was launched today in its heaviest ‘XL’ <br>
version with six strap-on motors of the first stage.<br>
 The launch took place from the First Launch Pad at the Satish<br>
Dhawan Space Centre SHAR (SDSC SHAR), Sriharikota,<br>
 the spaceport of India.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">The 320 tonne, 45 m tall PSLV-C30 carrying&nbsp; <br>
seven satellites including the 1513 kg ASTROSAT, lifted off at 10:00 Hrs IST.<br>
 About twenty two minutes after lift-off, ASTROSAT was successfully<br>
placed in orbit and separated from the fourth stage of PSLV-C30.&nbsp;<br>
 The separation of all the six co-passenger satellites was completed<br>
 in the subsequent three minutes. The seven satellites carried by PSLV-C30<br>
 together weighed about 1631 kg at lift-off.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="rtejustify">After a 50 hour smooth count down, the 320 ton <br>
PSLV-C28 was launched with the ignition of its first stage. <br>
The important flight events included the ignition and separation <br>
of the strap-ons, separation of the first stage, ignition of the second stage,<br>
 separation of the payload fairing after the vehicle had cleared the dense atmosphere,<br>
 second stage separation, third stage ignition and third stage separation, <br>
fourth stage ignition and fourth stage cut-off.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">Through 30 successful flights during 1994-2015 period,<br>
 PSLV has launched a total of 84 satellites including the seven <br>
satellites successfully launched today. The vehicle has repeatedly <br>
proved its reliability and versatility by successfully launching satellites<br> 
into a variety of orbits including polar Sun Synchronous, Geosynchronous<br>
 Transfer and Low Earth orbits of small inclination thereby emerging as<br>
 the workhorse launch vehicle of India.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="rtejustify">So far, 51 satellites have been launched by PSLV<br>
 for customers from abroad. Today’s launch of six co-passenger satellites<br>
 by PSLV-C30 was facilitated by Antrix Corporation Limited, the commercial<br>
 arm of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), a government of <br>
India Company under the Department of Space (DOS).&nbsp;</p>
Soon after its separation from PSLV-C30, the two solar<br>
 arrays of ASTROSAT were automatically deployed and the Spacecraft Control<br>
 Centre at the Mission Operations Complex of ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and<br> 
Command Network (ISTRAC) at Bangalore took control of ASTROSAT.
<p class="rtejustify">ASTROSAT is India’s first dedicated multi wavelength<br>
 space observatory. This scientific satellite mission endeavours for a more<br>
 detailed understanding of our universe.&nbsp; ASTROSAT is designed to observe<br> 
the universe in the Visible, Ultraviolet, low and high energy X-ray regions of<br>
 the electromagnetic spectrum simultaneously with the help of its five payloads.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="rtejustify">ASTROSAT was realised by ISRO with the participation<br> 
of all major astronomy institutions including Inter University Centre for<br>
 Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) of Pune, Tata Institute of Fundamental<br>
 Research (TIFR) at Mumbai, Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIAP) and <br>
Raman Research Institute (RRI) of Bangalore as well as some of the Universities<br>
 in India and two institutions from Canada and the UK.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">In the coming days, ASTROSAT will be brought to the final<br>
 operational configuration and all its five scientific payloads will be thoroughly<br>
 tested before the commencement of regular operations.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">Today’s successful flight of PSLV further underscores<br>
 the reliability and versatility of PSLV as well as the robustness of its design. &nbsp;</p>
